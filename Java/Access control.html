# Java access control
***
## Class
There are only two kinds of Java class access control.
* *public*. This keyword indicate that this class is available anywhere.
* *default*. Class without *public* keyword is only accessible to the classes in the same package. This fits helper classes which should not be visible to other packages.

**Note:** *private* or *protected* can not be used to modify class.

## Class member or method
There are four kinds of access control for class member or method.
| | Same class | Same package | Subclass in different package | Non-subclass in different package |
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
